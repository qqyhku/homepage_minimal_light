## About Me

I am a Ph.D. student at the [School of Computing and Data Science](https://www.cds.hku.hk/), The University of Hong Kong, working on robotics and mechanical engineering. My research focuses on developing innovative robotic grippers and manipulation systems for handling complex objects.

I am supervised by [Prof. Dong Xu](https://www.cs.hku.hk/people/academic-staff/dongxu) and [Prof. Peng Lu](https://mech.hku.hk/academic-staff/lu-p).

## Education

- **Ph.D. in Computer Science** (2023-present), School of Computing and Data Science, The University of Hong Kong
- **M.Sc. in Mechanical Engineering** (2022-2023), The University of Hong Kong  
- **B.Eng. in Mechatronics Engineering** (2018-2022), Zhejiang University

## Research Interests

- **Robotics:** robotic grippers, manipulation systems, shape-adaptive grasping
- **Mechanical Engineering:** mechanism design, dynamic modeling, control systems
- **Computer Vision:** object recognition, pose estimation for robotic applications

## News

- **[Jun. 2025]** Our paper "Lasso Gripper: A String Shooting-Retracting Mechanism for Shape-Adaptive Grasping" is available on arXiv.
- **[Sept. 2024]** Successfully developed a novel lasso-inspired gripper for handling oversized and delicate objects.
