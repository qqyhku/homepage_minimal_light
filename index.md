## About Me

I am a Ph.D. student at The University of Hong Kong, working on robotics and mechanical engineering. My research focuses on developing innovative robotic grippers and manipulation systems for handling complex objects.

## Research Interests

- **Robotics:** robotic grippers, manipulation systems, shape-adaptive grasping
- **Mechanical Engineering:** mechanism design, dynamic modeling, control systems
- **Computer Vision:** object recognition, pose estimation for robotic applications

## News

- **[Jun. 2025]** Our paper "Lasso Gripper: A String Shooting-Retracting Mechanism for Shape-Adaptive Grasping" is available on arXiv.
- **[Jun. 2025]** Successfully developed a novel lasso-inspired gripper for handling oversized and delicate objects.
