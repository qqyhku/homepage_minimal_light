## About Me

I am a Ph.D. student at the [School of Computing and Data Science](https://www.cds.hku.hk/), The University of Hong Kong, working on robotics and mechanical engineering. My research focuses on robotic grasping and manipulation, including the development of adaptive grippers and the integration of computer vision and tactile sensing for intelligent object handling. I am supervised by [Prof. Dong Xu](https://www.cs.hku.hk/people/academic-staff/dongxu) and [Prof. Peng Lu](https://mech.hku.hk/academic-staff/lu-p).

## Education

- **Ph.D. in Computer Science** (2023-present), School of Computing and Data Science, The University of Hong Kong
- **M.Sc. in Mechanical Engineering** (2022-2023), The University of Hong Kong  
- **B.Eng. in Mechatronics Engineering** (2018-2022), Zhejiang University

## Research Interests

- **Robotic Grasping:** Adaptive gripper design, shape-adaptive grasping, and manipulation planning
- **Computer Vision for Robotics:** 3D reconstruction, object recognition, and pose estimation for grasping
- **Tactile Intelligence:** Tactile sensing and embodied intelligence for robotic manipulation
- **Mechanical Design:** Mechanism design, dynamic modeling, and control systems

## News

- **[Jun. 2025]** Our paper "Lasso Gripper: A String Shooting-Retracting Mechanism for Shape-Adaptive Grasping" is available on arXiv.
- **[Sept. 2024]** Successfully developed a novel lasso-inspired gripper for handling oversized and delicate objects.
